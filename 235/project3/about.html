<h1>Crazy Pong(temporary name)</h1>
<h2>High Concept</h2>
<p>It's Pong but you have to deal with a lot more balls at once.
    The game would keep spawning balls until one of the players reaches a certain score.
    Once that happens, that player wins.</p>
<h2>Genre</h2>
<p>Sports, Action</p>
<h2>Platform</h2>
<p>Desktop web browser</p>
<h2>Story</h2>
<p>No real story here. It's just a game. Nothing crazy.</p>
<h2>Aesthetics</h2>
<p>This game would use pixel art. The design of the items and world would be kinda abstract. For sound, they will be 8 bit to fit the visual design.</p>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>You have to use your paddle to hit as many balls as you can into your opponent's goal, while trying to avoid getting them in your goal.
    The game itself would be multiplayer, with 2 players using the keyboard to play against each other. 
    The controls would be displayed on the title screen before the game starts.
</p>
<h2>Mockups</h2>

<h2>Other</h2>
<p>I'm thinking about using a certain PixiJS plugin, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/pixi-timer">Pixi Timer</a>. This could help with making more balls spawn after a period of time.
I'm not sure if I'll use it or not, but I at least wanted to make sure you were aware of it in case I do use it.</p>
<h2>About the developer</h2>
<p>I am a 3rd year Game Design and Development student. I have made multiple small games, where I have mainly been involved with programming and sound/music.
    I do have some experience making and handling pixel art as well.</p>
