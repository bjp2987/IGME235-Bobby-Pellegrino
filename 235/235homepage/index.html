<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I recently transferred here from Finger Lakes Community College. I've always wanted to be here at RIT, and I'm so glad I made it. I love playing video games, listening to music, and performing music.</p>

<h2>What I hope to get out of this class, as well as RIT</h2>
<p>As a Game Design and Development major, my goal is to learn how to make video games. In this class, I hope I will learn the tools to be able to make good websites for my games as well as other personal projects I may do.</p>
