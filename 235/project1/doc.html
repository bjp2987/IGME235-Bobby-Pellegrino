<h1>Documentation for Project 1</h1>
<p>Here is where I will explain how I made this project.<br>I started by using this prechosen layout:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/dccircuit/IGME-235-Fall-2023/blob/main/projects/_images/subaru.pdf">Original PDF</a><br>
I chose this because it was the layout that I felt made the most sense for a portfolio. I also already was imagining a set of boxes anyway, so it worked out.<br>
Here is my "sketch" of how I made the grid layout:</p>

<p>Additionally, my idea for the mobile layout would be this:</p>
<img src="src/gridvertical.png" alt="">
<p>Here is a link to my Phase 1 spec.html page: <a href="spec.html">spec.html</a><br>
The images used in that page are just clip art.</p>
<h2>My goal with this project</h2>
<p>My goal here is to make a portfolio for myself, featuring various game dev-related projects I have done over the past few years.</p>
<h2>Who is the target audience?</h2>
<p>Since this is a portfolio, the target audience here are potential game dev employers.</p>
<h2>Starting Phase 2</h2>
<p>Here is a bunch of information about this project's progression into Phase 2:</p>
<ul>
    <li>I changed the color palette, landing on a color scheme very different from the original PDF I started with. It's mainly green because it's my favorite color.</li>
    <li>All the images were replaced with images relating with the projects I put in this portfolio.
        The picture of me is my RIT ID card image, same as in the 235 Home Page.
        The images for most of the projects were images I already made at the time they were created.</li>
    <li>For the games and mod, I gave a link to their respective webpages where you can play/download them.</li>
    <li>Don't be alarmed by the first site I link to in the Oxygen Search area. I made that site in Google Sites as part of the requirements for that game/assignment, and it does a really good job explaining my role for the game, so I decided to include it anyway.</li>
    <li>The Maple Defense project was placed into the sidebar area because it is a game that I only ever conceptualized, and created a design document. That game is not playable, while the rest are. Thus, I linked to a PDF of the design document.</li>
    <li>I added a short introduction to myself, at the request of some of the people who gave me feedback. Since I'm a transfer student(and 3 of the projects were made at my previous college), I acknowledged both Finger Lakes Community College (my previous college) and RIT.</li>
    <li>I added a footer with some contact information for myself. Some people gave feedback suggesting I add it, so I did.</li>
</ul>
