<h1>Documentation for Project 1</h1>
<p>Here is where I will explain how I made this project.<br>I started by using this prechosen layout:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/dccircuit/IGME-235-Fall-2023/blob/main/projects/_images/subaru.pdf">Original PDF</a><br>
I chose this because it was the layout that I felt made the most sense for a portfolio. I also already was imagining a set of boxes anyway, so it worked out.<br>
Here is my "sketch" of how I made the grid layout:</p>

<p>Additionally, my idea for the mobile layout would be this:</p>

<p>Here is a link to my Phase 1 spec.html page: <a href="spec.html">spec.html</a><br>
The images used in that page are just clip art.</p>
<h2>My goal with this project</h2>
<p>My goal here is to make a portfolio for myself, featuring various game dev-related projects I have done over the past few years.</p>
